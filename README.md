# Hello-World
GitHub Tutorial Repository

Hello there,

I'm Web, new to coding. I've always had an interest, but never really persued it till now. Udemy is a blessing. I had checked the site at the right time for a flash sale.
I'll be mostly coding in Python 3 to start. Going to be following a 100-days boot camp. I'll pick up other languages as I go.
I do intend to get into some high level concepts such as ANNs and AI. I'd also like to learn a bit of Web/UX Developement, Cryptography, and Android/iOS.
Outside of Coding I have an interest in Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, and Biomechanical Engineering.

Well that's about it for now. See ya around.

Note to self: Try to implement what I learn with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
